# 61850 Converter Introduction

This protocol converter is very easy to use. Users only need to do some simple configurations to implement the conversion between RS485 Modbus and 61850, achieving one or more functions including telemetry (analog input acquisition), remote signaling (digital input acquisition), remote control (digital output control), and setpoint adjustment (parameter setting).

> The entire configuration process only requires: preparing a USB Type-C data cable to connect to the computer, and dragging the main.lua and model.cfg files generated by the configuration tool software into the protocol converter's USB drive.

## 1. Usage Recommendations

We provide two optional ways to configure the protocol converter: "Tool Configuration" and "Source Code Configuration":

- Tool Configuration (Recommended): It is recommended to use the desktop configuration tool software provided in `Tool Configuration` to configure this 61850 protocol converter, which is simpler and less error-prone.

- Source Code Configuration (Not Recommended): Although `Source Code Configuration` is more flexible and offers greater possibilities, it is only suitable for users with certain programming experience, and requires familiarity with Lua scripting and 61850 CID specifications.

> Advanced Users: Advanced users can also first use the configuration tool to automatically generate source code files, then manually fine-tune the main.lua source code file and rtu.cid file to implement some special customizations.

## 2. Tutorials

For usage methods and use cases of the tool software, please refer to the "Tool Configuration" folder.
